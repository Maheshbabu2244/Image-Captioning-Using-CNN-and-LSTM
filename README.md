# Image-Captioning-Using-CNN-and-LSTM
Image captioning using CNN and LSTM is a popular deep learning approach where a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) extracts image features, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network generates captions based on these features. The Flickr8k dataset is commonly used for training and evaluating image captioning models.

Steps to Implement Image Captioning with CNN & LSTM on Flickr8k
Dataset Preparation

Download the Flickr8k dataset, which contains 8,000 images and five captions per image.
Preprocess the text (tokenization, lowercase conversion, removing punctuations, padding).
Load and resize images.
Feature Extraction using CNN

Use a pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50, or InceptionV3) to extract feature vectors from images.
Remove the final classification layer and extract feature embeddings.
Text Preprocessing

Tokenize and convert words to numerical representations using Tokenizer (from Keras).
Create sequences of words with a maximum length.
Use word embedding (e.g., GloVe) to convert words into dense vectors.
LSTM-based Caption Generation

Design an LSTM network to take CNN features and generate captions.
Use an Embedding layer and an LSTM with attention mechanisms to improve context understanding.
Train the model using cross-entropy loss.
Model Training

Use an encoder-decoder framework:
The encoder (CNN) extracts image features.
The decoder (LSTM) generates captions step-by-step.
Train the model using teacher forcing (providing actual words as input during training).
Use Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
Inference & Caption Generation

Extract features from a new image using CNN.
Generate captions word-by-word using LSTM until an "end token" is reached.
